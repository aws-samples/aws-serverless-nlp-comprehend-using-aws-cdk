One of the exercises that she recommends is simply playing Solitaire with playing cards. It makes your eyes move and it's relaxing. Yes, it works. I've played Solitaire all day long, during lunch and then for a couple hours at night, gotten up the next day  and my eye muscles are actually sore. My eyesight slowly continues to improve.       So, I thought, along the lines of, 'if a little is better, then too much is great' that if Solitaire played with regular cards is great, then Solitaire played with gee-normous cards would be super-fantastic.       Lo and behold, it is! Not only do your eyes have to roam over a six foot area when you're playing Solitaire with these monsters, but it's a whole-body workout! If you are a sedentary person who does not care for exercise, then get a set of these, spread them out on the floor or on a six-foot table, put on your headphones and play away. Ditto if you are just trying to improve your eyesight or if your eyes are just tired after staring at a computer all day.","15089","2011","Toys"

They are great for home use and classroom use.  I use these cards as an attention grabbing manipulative to teach probability, sequencing, number games, fractions, recall (solitare), and many other math games.  They are so appealing that students want to learn math, and they provide those tactile skills you won't get with smaller decks of cards.      They're wonderful as a center activity for math centers or art centers.  I had one student who drew a perfect duplicate of the queen of hearts.  If you include them in a center, try to have at least two to four decks as students will argue over them.  They're relative inexpensive on Amazon.  If you can get your school to pickup the tab, all the better.     I try using the (7\\"" x 9\\"") cards in centers because it's quite an endeavor to house these in a center.  Also the super jumbo size might be an attractive nuisance--too much attention.  You know your students so be conscious of their inclinations.    I use them for both primary and secondary students (6th).  Even my high schoolers get a kick out of these cards--still babies.  There are also variations of the size of the cards.  These are the giant jumbo size. I use these and a smaller but larger size with my secondary students (7\\"" x 9\\"").  They are especially appealing to ESE students, ELL, and remedial students.    For example, divide the class into groups of three or four, lay the cards out on the floor or grass, and have each team flip three cards at once, if they match, the team gets to take those cards, if they don't match, the team must turn them over again.  The next team gets to try to recall where they saw the mate to the newly flipped card.  This is a huge game of solitare, but so much more exciting.     The skills and objectives are that students must be attentative, engaged, on-task, observant, listening, participating, focused, socially appropriate, strategic, thinking critically, and exposed to content area masterial, etc.     Forprobability, students get to have hands on experinece with the cards as a class.  The helpers lay out the cards and the class must determine how many cards are in the deck, how many diamonds, clubs, spades, and hearts, etc.  Students must figure out what are the chances of choosing a card that is a heart, diamond, spade, club, ace, black card, red card, 1,2,3..., and so on.        These cards go great with the following books that you can purchase on Amazon--inexpensive:    Gaslin, W. L., Lund, C., Gaslin, M. M. (2009).  Math games played with cards and dice k-1st.      Keatts, K. L.  (2000),  Mega fun card game math grades 1-3.    Lund, C.  (2009).  Math Games played with cards and dice 4-6.    Important note--If you're going to use them often, out of doors, or on the floor get them laminated. Students are rough on school supplies. Sometimes there's bad sportsmanship and they can get torn.","15048","2011","Toys"
